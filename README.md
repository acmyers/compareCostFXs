Exercise 2 from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Cousera course trains a logistic regression model using unconstrained nonlinear optimization.  The following code will compare the optimization objective function used in Ng's course (Method A) with a different method (Method B). The objective function in Method A is derived from the principal of maximum likelihood estimation, while the objective function in Method B is based on The Kelly Criterion.  More specifically, doubling rate of wealth.  The objective is to predict an applicant's probability of acceptance (1) or rejection (0) based on two exam scores.
